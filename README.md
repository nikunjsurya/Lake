# Lake-Ridge-Database-System
I developed a WPF C# application for my Final Project in Database Development that provides basic functionality for Lake Ridge Community Hospital. 
The application allows users to book appointments, create, read, update, and delete patient records and medical staff records. While it doesn't 
include all the features of a fully functional hospital management system, the application serves as a useful tool for managing appointments 
and records within the hospital.
